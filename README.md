# This is my initial repository where I will, for now, store code that comes from my learning and practice exercises for Codecademy.

# It is my hope that eventually I can link my github profile to certain applications for entry-level software positions and that potential employers
# will be able to see examples of my work and the pace and effort I have put into self-teaching.
